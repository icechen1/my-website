            I am a first year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
            <br />
            I develop various Android web apps, some of which are available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Yu+Chen+Hou">Google Play</a>.<br />
            On my free time I also enjoy photography, geocaching, biking, hiking, participating in hackathons, and occasionally playing games.
            <br />
            I consider technology and programming one of my greatest passions, as I contantly learn new things and solve problems while working on projects. <br />
            I am fascinated by how something as small as an app can reach and improve the life of many and I strive to work on projects that can impact people.<br/>
            To reach me, simply shoot me an <a href="mailto:me@yuchenhou.com">e-mail</a>! I'd love to discuss with you any project or work you may have in mind.
